<h1>Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookies!</h1>
<p>What, you say?  Cookies made of salmon?  Don't worry, they come in several varieties, and most don't taste like fish at all, but they all contain Pacific Northwest salmon.</p>
<p>
<h2>Our locations</h2>
<p>All stores open 6am to 9pm, seven days a week</p>
<h3>First and Pike</h3>
<p>Just a fish throw from Pike Place Market is our flagship location, on the south east corner of First and Pike.  You've seen salmon in the air, now see them on your plate.</p>

<h3>SeaTac Airport</h3>
<p>Need a last-minute gift for friends back home?  Try our location in the SeaTac Airport main terminal.  If you're in the neighorhood, it's worth it to buy a plane ticket to anywhere to get past security.</p>

<h3>Seattle Center</h3>
<p>In the shadow of the Space Needle is our Seattle Center store.  The Seattle World's Fair may be gone, but Pat's Salmon Cookies live on.</p>

<h3>Capitol Hill</h3>
<p>Sound Transit built a Link station just for our store!  Just kidding, but if you're in Seattle's most vibrant, dynamic neighborhood, we have a salmon cookie just for you.</p>

<h3>Alki</h3>
<p>Why did the first settlers choose Alki?  To reach our newest store just off Alki Beach.  Real salmon leap on to the beach to get a closer look.</p>
